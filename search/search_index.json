The editor in TopHat Pages itself is rather clumsy and has no good options for collaboration and version control. For example they make it hard to cut and paste content (e.g. no drag and drop and you'll lose all your latex formatting on a paste). A good markdown on the other hand allows one to embed practically all the visual and interactive elements of the final TopHat page (minus the gradebook-linked quations), it gives you a pretty faithful representation of what the final TopHat page will look like and is most like a format that TopHat will be able to easily convert into TopHat pages when we are done. With a good markdown editor (and MS Word can be used as one) you can type in math, insert images, URL links, and HTML elements including <iframe> tags to embed videos and other interactive content such as geogebra, interactive charts, etc. Some demos further down this page. Markdown tools and examples A markdown editor such as Typora gives a nice WYSIWYG rendering of all the elements and allows easy export to HTML or PDF for preview. Another markdown editor notable also doubles up as an organizer ( ala onenote or evernote) to keep snippets of material that you might use all organized in one place. Embedding videos and interactive content Videos Go to youtube or vimeo , click on the share option and find content. For example, to embed this video from JPAL on RCTs click on the share link underneath the video, then choose embed and you copy the html provided (see embed instructions ; note also option to start at a particular point in the video).
