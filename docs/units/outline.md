### **Introduction**

Could you make that pencil or that toaster? Specialization, Coordination, and Trade.
Economic history and long-term growth in standards of living.
Economic Issues today: epidemics, recession/unemployment, technological disruption, inequality, climate change.

### Scarcity, Opportunity Cost, Tradeoffs.

Choice on the Margin. Trade. Institutions and Incentives.
How do we judge outcomes? Simple examples of exchange to illustrate Pareto Efficiency, Fairness. Sen on limits of Pareto criterion, capabilities and freedom.

### Production Possibility Frontier

Economic models
Technological improvements frees up resources; 
Opportunity Cost, Comparative Advantage, and Specialization
Trade as another technology;

### The Capitalist Revolution  

Charts; growth. Technology, specialization, markets and trade; What  was different? (Markets, Property Rights and Firms).  What makes economies grow?  Inequality and the Environment.**Social Interactions I** (Game Theory; 2 classes); Invisible Hand Games, Prisoner's Dilemmas; in class games; Social dilemmas, coordination, cooperation, free-riding  **Social Interactions II** 
How do societies sustain coordination, cooperation, avoid free-riding? 
Institutions, Organizations; Cross-cultural evidence.  
Covid19 dilemmas.**Demand and Supply;** 
Shifts versus movement along; 
Examples.Applications, Comparative Statics; Examples
Consumer and Producer Surplus, 
Efficiency and Deadweight Loss.Price Ceilings and Price Floors
Quantitative Restrictions 
(very important.. basis for taxes, monopoly and much else);
**Quantitative Restrictions**  
Example: limited licenses to build; License rents;
Taxi medallion market, Uber;
Monopoly like optimally chosen QR
"Want Affordable Housing? Build more of it" **Elasticity and Taxes;**
A tax produces same effect as QR, rents go to tax authority;
Elasticity (informally) and tax burden sharing and DWL;
The war on drugs versus legalization and taxation.**Firms and Organizations** as hiearchies 
(Coase and earlier discussion of mechanisms to coordinate and limit free riding);

Economic versus accounting profits and the opportunity cost of the owners' time and resources.Firm Costs and Production Decisions;
Fixed costs and variable costs;
Marginal Cost and Average Cost Curves;

(P = minimum average cost)

Monopoly Rents, Technology and Creative Destruction **Market Power II:**
Oligopoly, Monopolistic Competition;
Price Discrimination;

History of Antitrust;
Monopoly, Monoposony and Public Policies
Evidence on market concentration**Market Failures;
Rivalry and Excludability;
Externalities** Negative and Positive (pollution; vaccines)
