### Average Cost Curves and Isoprofit Curves


$$
\Pi = (P-AC(Q))\cdot Q
$$
Drawn on a $Q \textit{ vs } P$ diagram the average cost curve tells us the price $P$ the firm would have to charge to exactly cover its costs and hence earn zero profits.  Hence the $AC(Q)$ curve is also the firm's zero-profit line.

Suppose the firm wanted to achieve a target level of profits at level $\bar \Pi$.  

### 

$$
\Pi = (P-AC(Q))\cdot Q
$$

Rearrange to find:
$$
P=AC(Q)+\frac{\bar \Pi}{Q}
$$
